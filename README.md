# Autonomous Car
This project was completed with one other team member. This project combined hardware and software to make a small battery powered car that can autonomously follow a line on the ground. We used a FREEDOM KL25Z board to control the hardware. The program uses a state machine to handle the different scenarios of input the car may recieve from its optical sensors.
